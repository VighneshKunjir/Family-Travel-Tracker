  - Users can add new countries they have visited and update their travel history as needed.
  ### Visual Representation:
  - The application provides an interactive world map that displays the countries visited by each family member.
  - Visited countries are highlighted and color-coded on the map, providing a visual representation of each user's travel history.
  ### Family Sharing:
  - Users can view each other's travel records, fostering a sense of shared travel experiences within the family.
  - The application encourages collaboration and discussion about past travels and future trip plans.
